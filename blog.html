            <p>Este's a friend of mine
                We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
                Este's been losing sleep
                Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity
                She says, "That ain't my merlot on his mouth"
                "That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
                No, there ain't no doubt
                I think I'm gonna call him out
                She says
                "I think he did it but I just can't prove it"
                I think he did it but I just can't prove it
                I think he did it but I just can't prove it
                No, no body, no crime
                But I ain't letting up until the day I die</p>

            <h4>2030.13.87</h4>
            <p>Este wasn't there
                Tuesday night at Olive Garden, at her job, or anywhere
                He reports his missing wife
                And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires
                And his mistress moved in
                Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
                No, there ain't no doubt
                Somebody's gotta catch him out
                'Cause
                I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)
                I think he did it but I just can't prove it (he did it)
                I think he did it but I just can't prove it
                No, no body, no crime
                But I ain't letting up until the day I die</p>
